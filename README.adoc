= MultiBoms

This is just a small https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] example to play around 
with so called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials[Bill-of-materials] 
(in Maven also known as https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies[importing dependencies]).

== Usage

You may simply install it by calling [userinput]#mvn install#. But is much more
interesting to look into the provided POM files:

* link:bom1/pom.xml[bom1] just has a dependencyManagement section which points to some Spring 
  libraries - which dependencies you choose is totally unimportant here.
* link:bom2/pom.xml[bom2] imports bom1 in its own dependencyManagement thereby inheriting
  the settings of that POM.
* link:testboms/pom.xml[testboms] finally imports the dependencyManagement of bom2 but also gets
  the dependencyManagement of bom1.
